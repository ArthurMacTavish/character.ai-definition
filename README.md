# Who am I in Character.AI?
[Halo semuanya](https://translate.google.com/?sl=id&tl=en&text=Halo%20semuanya&op=translate), I'm Reuben Hu, better known as Arthur MacTavish on Character.AI and numerous other social media platforms.

# Are you writing these character definitions on your own?
No, I don't. I use some tools to help me, so I can make character definitions faster (essentially a dialogue). Here are some of them:

- [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com/) (For fixing general grammatical errors + typos)
- [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (Creating different quotes variants and tone adjustments)
- [Character.AI](https://character.ai/) (Where I host the character and help me to polish the character definition further)
- [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) (English is my secondary language, so sometimes it can be pretty overwhelming for me as an Indonesian)

# How do you get these profile photos?
It's not me. It's not anyone. It's AI-generated, powered by [Microsoft Bing Image Creator](https://bing.com/create/).

# May I distribute, reuse, or do anything with the character definition?
Absolutely! The character definition repository is licensed under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/), which basically means no copyright, no licensing nonsense, and no, seriously.

However, this is not equally true for the character's profile photo. According to [Microsoft Bing Conversational Experiences and Image Creator Terms](https://www.bing.com/new/termsofuse/), while Microsoft does not claim ownership of images created using AI, Microsoft only allows the use of AI-generated photos for **personal and non-commercial use**.

# May I use this character definition on Character.AI?
I want to make this crystal clear. I can't prohibit you from copying without modification due to the CC0 license (I don't own a single thing in this repository).

Nevertheless, I really encourage you to improve my character definition, and maybe you can make a better character bot than mine. I'm happy to see when I can at least help you in some capacity.

# How do I support you?
You can support me by sharing the characters I made in Character.AI, as simple as that.

# I just want to try your character!
