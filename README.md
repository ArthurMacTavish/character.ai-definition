# Who am I in Character.AI?
[Halo semuanya](## "Hello, everyone in Indonesian"), I'm Reuben Hu, better known as Arthur MacTavish on Character.AI and numerous other social media platforms.

# Are you writing these character definitions on your own?
No, I don't. I use some tools to help me, so I can make character definitions faster (essentially a dialogue). Here are some of them:
- [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com/) (For fixing general grammatical errors + typos)
- [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (Creating different quotes variants and tone adjustments)
- [Character.AI](https://character.ai/) (Where I host the character and help me to polish the character definition further)
- [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) (English is my secondary language, so sometimes it can be pretty overwhelming for me as an Indonesian)

# How do you get these profile photos?
It's not me. It's not anyone. It's AI-generated, powered by [Microsoft Bing Image Creator](https://bing.com/create/).

# May I distribute, reuse, or do anything with the character definition?
Absolutely! The character definition repository is licensed under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/), which basically means no copyright, no licensing nonsense, and no, seriously.

However, this is not equally true for the character's profile photo. According to [Microsoft Bing Conversational Experiences and Image Creator Terms](https://www.bing.com/new/termsofuse/), while Microsoft does not claim ownership of images created using AI, Microsoft only allows the use of AI-generated photos for **personal and non-commercial use only**.

# May I use this character definition on Character.AI?
I want to make this crystal clear. I can't prohibit you from copying without modification due to the CC0 license (I don't own the entire thing). However, from an ethical standpoint, it is generally discouraged to copy someone else creation without making any modifications.

However, I really encourage you to improve my character definition, and maybe you can make a better character bot than mine. I'm happy to see when I can at least help you in some capacity.
